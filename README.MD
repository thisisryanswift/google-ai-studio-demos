# AI Studio Demo Steps

1.  Grab an API Key and replace the value in `.env`
2.  Setup a new python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  Activate your virtual environment:

    For Windows (PowerShell):

    ```powershell
    venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```
    For macOS/Linux (bash/zsh):

    ```bash
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    ```
4.  Bounce between VS Code and AI Studio as you perform each demo.
